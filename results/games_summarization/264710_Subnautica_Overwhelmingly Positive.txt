SUMMARY FOR GAME Subnautica----------------------------------------
Subnautica has garnered a passionate following, with players raving about its immersive underwater experience. Many reviewers highlight the game’s exceptional atmosphere, where the combination of breathtaking visuals and a haunting soundscape creates a chilling yet beautiful environment. Players frequently express their admiration for the game's deep lore and exploration mechanics, emphasizing the thrill of uncovering secrets in a world filled with both charming and terrifying creatures. The gameplay is often described as addictive, with players enjoying the challenge of resource gathering and base building, alongside the adrenaline rush that comes from encounters with menacing leviathans.

However, despite the positive sentiments, a significant number of players have voiced their frustrations regarding technical issues and the direction of the game's development.

Players report save corruption and game-breaking glitches that can hinder progress, leading to a sense of wasted time and effort. Complaints about the game's pacing and lack of direction in the late game also surfaced, with some players feeling that the experience devolves into tedious fetch quests rather than engaging exploration.

There is also a palpable disappointment concerning the game's current ownership and management under Krafton, with many expressing concerns over the company's perceived negligence towards the community and the game’s legacy.

This has led to a divided community, where the love for the game is overshadowed by frustration with its corporate stewardship.

In summary, while Subnautica remains a beloved title for its innovative survival horror mechanics and captivating underwater exploration, players should approach with caution. The technical issues and corporate decisions have left a bitter taste for some, indicating that it might be wise to wait for improvements or sales before diving in completely. For those who appreciate a good horror game with a unique setting, it may still be worth experiencing, but potential buyers should be prepared for the possibility of encountering significant frustrations along the way.
