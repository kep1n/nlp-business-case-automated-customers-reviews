The user reviews for the game with AppID: 2067780 reveal a passionate community highly engaged with its narrative elements and character development. Many players laud the game for its compelling storytelling, which they describe as one of the most captivating they have encountered in any medium.

Players find themselves invested in the outcomes, often expressing regret when forced to choose between likable characters. The interactive gameplay mechanics and unique art style further enhance the overall experience, with some users even expressing a desire to see the game adapted into an anime, underscoring its cinematic quality.

However, despite the overwhelmingly positive feedback, several complaints have emerged, primarily related to the game’s development timeline. A recurring concern among players is the lack of substantial updates over the past two years.

This uncertainty surrounding future content has left a shadow over the otherwise enthusiastic reception, as some players are hesitant to recommend the game without knowing if they will see its conclusion.

In summary, while the game shines with its storytelling and character engagement, the prolonged development pause has created a divide among players. Those enchanted by the narrative and gameplay mechanics will find a jewel worth exploring, but the lack of updates may deter potential newcomers. Given these considerations, this game can be categorized as a "Must-Play" for fans of visual novels and emotional narratives, while those wary of unfinished projects may want to wait for clearer signs of its ongoing development.
