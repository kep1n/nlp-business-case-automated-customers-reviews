        <!-- Subnautica -->
        <article class="game-summary">
            <h3>🌊 Subnautica</h3>

            <p>However, despite the positive sentiments, a significant number of players have voiced their frustrations regarding technical issues and the direction of the game's development. A recurring theme in negative reviews is the discontent surrounding recent updates, particularly those that have disrupted modding capabilities and introduced bugs. Players report save corruption and game-breaking glitches that can hinder progress, leading to a sense of wasted time and effort.

            <p>In the latest remaster of Misao, players are treated to a blend of stunning visuals, engaging storytelling, and a nostalgic nod to the horror genre. Many reviewers praise the game's beautiful art style and its ability to weave dark themes such as guilt, bullying, and vengeance into an emotionally charged narrative.

Complaints also arise regarding the gameplay's absurd difficulty and the lack of meaningful exploration, with some players feeling punished for simply interacting with the game world.</p>

            <p>In summary, Misao – 2024 HD Remaster offers a compelling mix of emotional depth and aesthetic charm that resonates with many players.
